    <h2>Welcome to my website about craps.</h2>
       
    <section>It is a site detailing the current knowledge about the game, theories, ramblings, and all stuff because there is no reason to stop.</section>
    
        <h2>Why did I make this site</h2>
        <section>When I started this site I wanted to provide something I could never find.  A site that details the expected value of multiple bets, details the randomness of dice/independent events with the aspects of the game, and uses the game boards as the tool for looking at all this information.  So I decided to just make something on my own that I could use and then decide to share it as a fun project. </section>
    
        <h2>Do I "know" I can win?</h2>
        <section>The expected value of craps is always negative for every bet, so increasing the number of bets (frequency of bets or total bets on each roll) just like increasing the magnitude of your bets or increasing the amount of money wagered will just increase the amount of loss.  So remember the casino is not gambling when they offer these specifc payouts, you are the gambler.  I am the gambler.</section>
    
        <h2>So I must like losing money, huh?</h2>
        <section>There are interesting aspects of craps, like being able to control the decision device: the dice; and there a few non-contract bets which allow you to remove your money and reduce the total amount at risk.  These are pretty unique aspects of any casino game.  You play for the enjoyment, free booze, occasional hot roll.  Everyone should leave before they notice that the 'laws of casino gambling' are inevitable and the casino executives have <strong>ALL</strong> your money locked in their vault.</section>
