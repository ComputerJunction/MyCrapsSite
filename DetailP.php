        <h2>Expected Value</h2>
        The expected value of a random occurrence, variable, roll of the dice in this game, can be calculated by sum (a) of the probabilities (b) of the different possible roll outcomes multipled by the payout (c) of that specific outcome.  This must take into account all the possible outcomes, positive and negative, wins and losses.

        <h2>Standard Deviation</h2>
        The risk level also needs to be measured with another statistical tool.  The variance to the rescue, this is calculated by taking the EV minus the mean multipled by the squared deviations.  Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and can be used as a single unit of measure for risk.</section>

        Steps: Find EV, now setup that same formula and before multiplying by the probability subtract EV from whole number win or loss and square those separate calculations, </section>
